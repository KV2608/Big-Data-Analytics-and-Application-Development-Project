# Big Data Analytics and Application Development Project

## Overview
This project analyzes over 100 million climate records from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) using Hadoop and Spark technologies.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hadoop MapReduce (MRJob)
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Apache Pig
- Apache Hive
- HDFS

## Key Analytics

### Average Wind Direction
Computed using Hadoop MapReduce with MRJob, handling missing and invalid records to ensure data quality.

### Sky Ceiling Height Range
Calculated using PySpark RDDs and aggregateByKey operations, improving performance by approximately 30%.

### Visibility Distance Analysis
Implemented using Pig scripts and Hive queries to compute visibility ranges and averages across weather stations.

## Achievements
- Processed 100M+ climate records from NCDC
- Achieved 25–30% performance improvement through optimization
- Built scalable big data applications on the Hadoop ecosystem
